These are the final projects of the 10th graders
I taught python to in my senior year of high school
We had one trimester to learn everything, so I was quite happy with
the results. As this was my first time teaching (albeit in an informal 
environment) I also learned quite a bit. 

ALL PROGRAMS NEED PYGAME TO RUN
most need Collision.py too
